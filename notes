Path following
transition:
- reward by shrinking distance to next waypoint
- switch between waypoints consecutively
reward:
- potential based - using
- Matt's way - implemented

q
- fine-grained q table - try it
- potential based

sanity check
- weights and discounters, forward then backward - TODO

==============
- consider all the module instances - makes sense, go for it
- check path constraint module again
- evaluation
  - probability of observing human data given model - done
  - Ng's IRL
  - baselines: reflex, round-robin - done
