Heat map on object values. Adjust color.

=====================

Path following - larger path waypoint and train again.
Matt proposes:
- If get closer to the current one compared to the past one,
  move ahead to the next one.
- Consider the distance to the path segment, and progress made
  to approach the next waypoint.
- Consider the past, current and next segment.

Agreement on policies.
