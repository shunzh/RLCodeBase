=====================

Path following - larger path waypoint?
Matt proposes:
- If get closer to the current one compared to the past one,
  move ahead to the next one.
- Consider the distance to the path segment, and progress made
  to approach the next waypoint.
- Consider the past, current and next segment.

Larger size for obstacles (Different from human ?).

Agreement on policies.
