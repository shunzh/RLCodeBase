Question 2, 3
Generally, if the living reward is negtive, the agent would try to exit as fast as possible, thus preferring closer exit. If the living reward is large and positive, then the agent would prefer to live forever, refusing to exit.
The higher the noises, the higher chance of falling off the cliff. This causes the agent to behave less risky.
The lower discount makes the distant future reward less valuable.

Question 6
It's impossible. 
If epsilon is big, the agent moves randomly and not likely to reach the goal in only 50 episodes.
If epsilon is small, it tends to stick to its starting point because of higher reward, and it doesn't explore much. So it won't discover the higher reward on the other side of the bridge.
